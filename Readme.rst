Introduction
************


IoT stands for Internet of Things.  As per the IEEE ( IEEE, ”Internet of Things” , 2014) Internet of Things is defined as “A network of items embedded with sensors which are connected to the internet”,

The usual internet we all know is a network of networks which comprise of computers, servers and many networks. For example when you access Youtube.com you access through your computer and retrieve data from another server which again a computer via the network.
With the advancement of computer networks many device are connected to this internet. For example now your  ,Tab, home thermostat, cameras and other devices & appliances are connected to the internet. These connected devices through the internet creates a broader network of computers and devices is now capable of transferring data between devices through the network even without human interaction. This is called the Internet of Things. This can be a small device as small as a pill or can be big as an aero plane.
If you take a GPS tracker on a vehicle, you can monitor the vehicle in real time. Now you can check your home security camera feed from your phone. Another classic example is the Smart home concept of connected smart devices that can be used for home automation. This larger network of devices and appliances  collectively as a network is called the internet of Things.
Internet of things will be a dominant force in the industries in future. It is predicted that about 50 Billion devices will be connected to internet by end of 2020. Those will generate 4.4 zettabytes of data. IoT industry will grow to a 14.4 Billion dollar industry by 2025.

Industry 4.0
************

Industry 4.0 is the name given for the next technical revolution that will take place with the increasing blend of smart technologies with transitional  or legacy industries.
Some of the key aspects of this will be increased automation, speed and accurate communication, efficient real time monitoring and machines which can communicate without human interaction. Internet of Things or IoT will play a major role in this technology transformation because massive scale machine to machine communication is the concept behind IoT. The other technologies like robotics, Artificial Intelligence(AI), Machine Learning(ML) will also be a quintessential part of this technical revolution. 

The increase of automation and self-monitoring machines is in industries has already begun reducing human workforce in manufacturing related industries. 

The replacement of human involvement in industries will urge to direct the human work force to find more creative solutions and innovations for problems human kind face in becoming more efficient with supplies to the growing population and demand throughout the world. This is why the most required skills in industry 4.0 would be creativity and innovation.

A simple application of IoT can be used for a temperature monitoring application. For example the temperature at a given location or a space would be a key measurement in certain applications such a agriculture and commercial storages. In these applications a temperature sensor which can be connected to the internet will be used and the data is transmitted to a cloud application via internet protocols. The data can be visualized in real time based on the values generated through the sensor. This is a simple sample application. The scaled up version of this implementation would be a weather station network with IoT.

Components of Internet of Things
==========

Internet of Things has two main components Internet and Things. Applications, protocols and interconnected network is called the Internet and every component with connectivity to the internet is referred to as a “Thing”.  In technical terms, according to IEEE IoT architecture has 3 components.

- Physical 
- Gateway
- Services

The physical layer is comprised of devices, gateway is the network used for communication and services are the data handling part in application layer which is commonly is the cloud.

******
Device
******

Devices are the hardware devices any other physical device connected to the IoT network. This could include below categories of devices.

- Sensors – Temperature, Humidity, proximity, GPS, accelerometer
- Actuators- Motors, bulbs, Switches
- Human interface devices – household appliances, PCs, Tabs
- Computers and smart devices
- Network devices- routers, switches

The physical devices mainly do the analog data conversion to digital signals and collect data. The devices have remote connectivity and real time data transmission with secured channels.

*******
Network
*******

Connecting of billions of new devices to the internet is a great expansion of the network. IPV6 plays a major role in connecting these devices with scalable unique addresses for all. Different protocols are used to for communication like http, https and light weight protocols like ZeroMQ and MQTT. 
The devices sometimes act and edge computing nodes processing certain amounts of data to have better solutions but in most cases the data is transmitted to the cloud at once where connectivity plays a major role. This is where the wired and wireless technologies comes into play. Below are some of the most popular communication technologies. 
•	Wireless Communication – Bluetooth, NFC,  Wifi, ZigBee,  LTE, 5G
•	Wired Communication -  Ethernet, Power line communication(PLC)

Cloud
*****

Cloud is the application and presentation layer of the IoT architecture. The servers and computes processing the data are referred to as the cloud platform here. IoT data storing, processing and presentation part happens here. For example a dashboard is a web based representation of a data set collected through many or single IoT node. Below is a screenshot of an implementation of a dashboard done with ThingsBoard platform.

Security
========


Security is one of the most controversial areas related to IoT. The common security challenges in traditional internet such as authentication, data leakage, unauthorized access and many other aspects are related to IoT as well. Perhaps the data transmission without encryption is one of the major issues in many cases. The operational and computation limitations of IoT devices may limit the functionality to enforce greater security measures at the device end. A popular example is the Mirai botnet incident in 2016 where it is reported that nearly 300,000 IoT devices were infected to an attack. 
The security measures have to be implemented in each of the layers of IoT starting form policy level changes to protocol and program level changes.
 
IoT Security Foundation was launched in 2015 to ensure the future of the security aspects of IoT. The rapid growth of IoT will demand for better secured platforms and channels for security of data as well.

Components of Cloud platform 
============================

***********************
What is Cloud Computing
***********************

Cloud Computing technologies are emerging as a common way of provisioning infrastructure services, applications and general computing and storage resources on-demand. (IEEE)
The term cloud stands for the on-demand available computer system resources connected through a network which operates without human direct human management. Cloud is an essential part of the IoT architecture as mentioned before. The Cloud also comprises several components with different features. We need the cloud platform to handle, processing, visualize and store the data from IoT networks. 
Although there could be many components and architectures related to cloud platforms, here we refer to the cloud platforms related to IoT only. The models of cloud computing used with IoT is commonly Platform as a service(PaaS) or Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS).
Below are some of the key components of any cloud platform with IoT.

Device manager - Provisioning/ Monitoring
=========================================

The IoT end devices will be connected to the cloud application. The authentication of devices to retrieve data should be done by the platform by registering only specified and known devices related to the network. This registration of devices happen through the device manager of the cloud platform.
The IoT devices will be registered through device managers by unique IDs and keep the devices connected to the platform by authenticating the correct devices. The security handling part of encryption is also handled by the device management based on keys or certificates.
Device manager will also display the status of the devices and the total registered device list for a cloud application. Some management applications provide alerts in the event of a device failure. 
To summarize below are the functions of the device manger.

- Registration of IoT devices for cloud platform with defined parameters like device names
- Management of devices such as add, remove or modify remotely
- Monitoring of IoT devices connected
- Alerts on device status and operation
- Device authentication and data encryption

Database
========
 
The database in a cloud application is the primary data storage. This process is also called as data ingestion in scenarios such as IoT platforms. This means that data is transferred from one location to another to analyze and process further. In IoT architecture while some data processing might happen in edge computing devices the majority of the data chunks are moved to the cloud. This data is stored in databases to analyze and processing. The on demand nature of cloud platform provides the elasticity for the databases to adjust based on the requirement with or without human intervention.

Analytics 
=========

The process of data ingestion can happen in real time or in batches or as a combination of both. The analysis part is occurred in cloud based on the system requirement. The batch data are imported on regular intervals as aggregated data and processed in scheduled intervals. The real time data analysis is performed for very time specific and time sensitive operations. For example if we take a vehicle tracking system, the tracking should happen in real time. The data can be processed to give meaningful values using the defined formulas which is called analysis. Sometimes the analysis will require to represent the real time values over a period. 
Some of the most popular technologies that are currently used for analytics is big data analytics, machine learning and AI.

Dashboard
=========

Dashboards are the representation of processed data. The visualization of the data in the presentation layer of the architecture happens through the dashboard. A dashboard could have graphs, tables, values, maps, diagrams or any other graphic which displays a meaning value of processed data of the IoT network. 
This could be a online dash board or hosted in a single location. However most IoT related dashboards are accessible over the internet with multiple devices such as computers, Tabs or mobiles.
Below is a sample picture of a weather station dashboard.

As most of the devices have computational power at the node itself IoT devices enable edge computing as well where a certain level of processing can happen. For example the temperature can be monitored at a location and an alarm can be generated to a cloud application only when a specific limit is exceeded.
The devices of an IoT network can be either a sensor or can actuator or edge computing devices together with the sensors.
